# DNA_classifier
Ultimate objective: Use DNA sequence to determine population group of person

As of 2021/06/29 1755hrs:
downloadData.py - downloads one hardcoded zipped sequence data file (.filt.fastq.gz) of one sample and stores it into ./phase3_data/sampleID/
parseSequence.py - reads the data in the one unzipped data file (.filt.fastq) and stores the raw sequence from it in a plain text file (.txt)
next to do: 1) include unzipping process in code; 2) make code download all files of one sample; 3) make code download files for all samples
